System Dynamics in Python 
A revival of a classic - reborn in the age of AI. 

Under the shadow of probability, may the wisdom of systems thinking endure. 
This Repo began with Prof. Maximilian Schueler’s curiosity and vision, 
and was later expanded (and occasionally bugged or debugged) by Xinyuan. 

It also stands in honor of the late Prof. Hartmut Bossel - a true systems thinker, ahead of his time, 
who probably saw this coming. 

Long live stocks and flows. 
Long live feedback loops.
And may our simulations forever reinforce themselves—positively, for sure.
