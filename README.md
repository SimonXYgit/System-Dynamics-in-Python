System Dynamics in Python <br>
A revival of a classic - reborn in the age of AI. <br>

Under the shadow of probability, may the wisdom of systems thinking endure. <br>
This Repo began with Prof. Maximilian Schuelerâ€™s curiosity and vision, <br>
and was later expanded (and occasionally bugged or debugged) by Xinyuan. <br>

It also stands in honor of the late Prof. Hartmut Bossel - a true systems thinker, ahead of his time, <br>
who probably saw this coming. <br>

Long live stocks and flows. <br>
Long live feedback loops.<br>
And may our simulations forever reinforce themselves - positively, for sure.<br>
